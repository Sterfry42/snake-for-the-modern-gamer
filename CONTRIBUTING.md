# Contributing to Snake: For the modern gamer

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! We welcome any and all contributions, from bug reports to new features.

## Code of Conduct

We want to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. To that end, we have a simple code of conduct that we expect all contributors to follow.

### Be Kind

The most important rule is to be kind and respectful to one another. We are all here to build something cool together. Disagreements may happen, but they should be handled with civility. Personal attacks, harassment, or any form of exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.

Let's strive to make this a community where people feel comfortable asking questions, proposing ideas, and participating in discussions.

### Our Inspiration

For a more detailed set of principles that we admire and strive to follow, please refer to the [Linux kernel's Code of Conduct](https://docs.kernel.org/process/code-of-conduct.html). We believe it provides an excellent framework for collaborative development.

Thank you for helping us make this a great community!
